# MovieWorld
The project refers to a web application designed for movie critics.
Initially non-registered users have the option to view all available movies that are uploaded by other users including information such as:
  
  1. The title of the movie followed by a description of it,
  2. The name of the person who uploaded it,
  3. The date which was uploaded

Registered users also have the option to add new movies to the database while non-registered users do not have that option.

# How to run the app
Initially you need to open a code editor like PhpStorm, SublimeText,Visual Studio Code etc and start the symfony server by typing:

                                              symfony server start
                                              
Once you've started the server you will have to navigate to the localhost:8000 which will show you the initial page of the app
