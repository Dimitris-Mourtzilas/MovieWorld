# MovieWorld
The project refers to a web application designed for movie critics.
Initially non-registered users have the option to view all available movies that are uploaded by other users including information such as:
  
  1. The title of the movie followed by a description of it,
  2. The name of the person who uploaded it,
  3. The date which was uploaded

Registered users also have the option to add new movies to the database while non-registered users do not have that option.
